# ETL_project Report
### by Criselda Dimacali and Niha Manduri
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is impacting everyone, some more drastically than others. We wanted to understand how many people tested positive that were hospitalized. Additionally, we wanted to see how many people that recovered were likely to be asymptomatic. Furthermore we broke down these numbers to understand how many of these deaths were pneumonia related deaths, influenza related deaths or COVID-19 related deaths.  

We have shown our work of Extraction, Transformation and Loading our data into a database using HTML pages. Please use this link  to review our findings. [ETL Project Report Link](https://nmanduri999.github.io/ETL_pages/)
